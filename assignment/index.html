        I am a Parrothead, or big Jimmy Buffett fan.  I listen to Radio Margaritaville
        almost every day and have been to three of Jimmy's concerts:
        <ul>
          <li>Wrigley Field, Chicago, IL: July 15, 2017</li>
          <li>Target Field with The Eagles, Minneapolis, MN: June 30, 2018</li>
          <li>Alpine Valley, Elkhorn, WI: July 20, 2019</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        Some of my favorite Jimmy Buffett songs:
        <ul>
          <li>Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On</li>
          <li>The Captain and the Kid</li>
          <li>The Night I Painted the Sky</li>
          <li>When the Coast is Clear</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        I love rollercoasters. I have worked at some of them including Wild Thing at Valleyfair,
        and Primeval Whirl at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida.  My favorite is Steel Vengeance at
        Cedar Point in Ohio.

        My family has a cabin on Lake Alexander in Cushing, MN.  It has been my
        favorite place to spend time this summer.
