I put single quotes for where I would insert another name of a location or file.

# Type your responses on a new line

# 1 - What is the command for listing the files in the current folder (directory)?

ls

# 2 - What is the command for changing directories?

cd 'directory I want to change to'

# 3 - What is the command for going back a folder (to a parent directory)?

cd ..

# 4 - What is a quick way to create a new folder?

mkdir 'name I want to give new folder'

# 5 - What output would you expect when you run the command 'ls' in an empty folder? What about a folder containing files?

For the first scenario, there should be no text displayed, as there are no contents to list in the terminal.
For the second, the terminal should display the contents of the current folder in a list, but only
at the next level down.  If there is another folder with files there, its contents will not be
displayed until the current directory is changed and ls is run again.

# 6 - What is a quick way to create a new file?

touch 'file name I want to create. file type'

# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output

git version 2.28.0

# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?

The command 'git status' displays a result that lets the user know if there have been any modifications to
the files that git tracks since the last commit was made.  If the file that is saved is identical to the file
that git has a copy of, the terminal will show that everything is up to date.  If changes have been made to any file,
the reply in the terminal will show which files have had modifications made to them since the last commit so that
it is known if another commit is needed to keep those changes in Git.

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?

The command 'git add .' adds the changes to all files in the current directory that Git is tracking to the staging area so that these
changes can be committed and saved to Git to retrieve if needed later.

# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?

git push -u origin master
