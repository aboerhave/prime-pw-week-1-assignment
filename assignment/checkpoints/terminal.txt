# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?

The command 'git status' displays a result that lets the user know if there have been any modifications to
the files that git tracks since the last commit was made.  If the file that is saved is identical to the file
that git has a copy of, the terminal will show that everything is up to date.  If changes have been made to any file,
the reply in the terminal will show which files have had modifications made to them since the last commit so that
it is known if another commit is needed to keep those changes in Git.

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?

# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
